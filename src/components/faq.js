          For loans originated starting in 2020, students have the option to
          enroll in Autopay with our payment processor, Launch Servicing. There
          are numerous benefits for enabling Autopay:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc">
          <li>
            Save on interest. You will receive a .25% reduction in the interest
            rate on your loan as long as you remain signed up for Autopay.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid late fees. With Autopay, your monthly loan payments are
            automatic, so you never have to worry about missing a payment and
            incurring late fees.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Protect your credit. By ensuring on-time payments, Autopay protects
            your credit from missed payments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-0 pb-4">
          And remember, there are no restrictions on pre-payment, so in addition
          to your automatic payments, you can also pay down your loan early
          which will reduce the total amount of interest you will pay over the
          life of the loan.
