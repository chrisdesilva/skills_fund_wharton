    <h2 className="py-4 text-center">Qualifying for Skills Fund Financing</h2>
    <p>
      Our underwriting reflects an investment in your future success. Skills
      Fund does not use current income nor employment history in your credit
      decision, and you may qualify for a Skills Fund loan if you meet the basic
      underwriting criteria, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          You are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder)
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          No bankruptcies or history of default on a public or private loan
        </strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Worried about your credit health? You may either add a cosigner to begin
      your loan application, or following credit denial, you may be given the
      opportunity to add a cosigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All approved students are given the same low rate - with or without a
      cosigner. And there's no prepayment penalty with a Skills Fund loan.
