    <p>
      Our goal at Skills Fund is to help students from all walks of life and
      with a broad range of backgrounds get access to the programs that interest
      them. We offer two possible ways to qualify for a Skills Fund loan: on
      your own or with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner can help strengthen your
      application’s overall credit health, and may even help lower your loan’s
      interest rate, APR, or monthly payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skills Fund applicants must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident with
      established credit history and no outstanding educational loan defaults. A
      student who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident or has
      Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status may apply with a
      creditworthy cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qualification depends on credit profile, and minimum credit requirements
      may vary by school and loan term.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see if you pre-qualify for a Skills Fund loan, submit an application.
      In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with
      no impact to your credit score. In addition to learning more about your
      eligibility, you can also see the rates and terms you pre-qualify for.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our application process asks for income and employment details, we
      won’t use income, employment, or your requested loan amount to evaluate
      your application.
