        <p>Our underwriting reflects an investment in your future success. Skills Fund does not use current income nor employment history in your credit decision, and you may qualify for a Skills Fund loan if you meet the basic underwriting criteria, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No bankruptcies or history of default on a public or private loan</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Worried about your credit health? You may either add a cosigner to begin your loan application, or following credit denial, you may be given the opportunity to add a cosigner.</p>
        <p>All approved students are given the same low rate - with or without a cosigner. And there's no prepayment penalty with a Skills Fund loan.</p>
