    <p>
      Our underwriting reflects an investment in your future success. Skills
      Fund does not use current income nor employment history in your credit
      decision, and you may qualify for a Skills Fund loan if you meet the basic
      underwriting criteria, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>You are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          You are enrolled in a program at a Skills Fund partner school
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Eligibility depends on credit history and may vary by school
        </strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Worried about your credit health? You may either add a cosigner to begin
      your loan application, or following a credit denial, you may be given the
      opportunity to add a cosigner.
    </p>
    <p>And remember, there's no prepayment penalty with a Skills Fund loan.</p>
